    Located a one-minute walk from Ikebukuro Exit 35, our clinic is open weekdays from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), including weekends and holidays. We strive to remain a convenient clinic for our patients. To that end, we regularly conduct patient surveys and incorporate their feedback.
Based on many of our patients' feedback, we have established a system where patients can arrive at our clinic at 8:00 AM on weekdays and have their consultation and payment completed by 9:00 AM, allowing them to prioritize their work and life commitments. Additionally, for those who wish to leave the clinic earlier than 9:00 AM, we offer a system where patients can leave immediately after their blood draw and pelvic exam and receive the results and treatment plan via phone the same day, or in the evening after work.
Since egg collection and implantation require patients to arrive at designated times, we have incorporated feedback from our patient surveys to minimize the need to take time off work. Furthermore, if samples are prepared between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM, we are able to provide artificial insemination, semen analysis, and sperm freezing services until 8:00 PM.

   Even if cervical cancer is detected during our screening, Dr. Kyoko Tanaka, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Toho University School of Medicine, will provide medical care. Dr. Kyoko Tanaka has extensive experience performing uterine preservation surgeries (108 cases from 2011 to 2022, and one in 2022). We also offer infertility testing and treatment. Depending on the case (e.g., when heparin treatment or surgery is required), we may refer patients to specialized hospitals. For male infertility, we offer monthly consultations with Dr. Masakazu Ohashi, who specializes in male infertility treatment. We can also refer patients to our affiliated Ebisu Tsuji Clinic . After pregnancy, fetal ultrasounds can be performed by Dr. Mamoru Tanaka, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Keio University School of Medicine, upon request. For patients requesting NIPT testing , we refer them to Dr. Kazuhiro Minegishi, director of Hiroo Minegishi Obstetrics and Gynecology .

We believe it is important to acquire the latest knowledge in the ever-evolving medical field, and so we actively participate in academic conferences. By sharing the knowledge and insights we gain at conferences with other staff, we aim to improve our teamwork and knowledge. We also incorporate tests and treatments that are thought to be effective, create the optimal incubation environment, and work as a team to help as many patients as possible become pregnant.
