    <h1>Egg Freezing (Social Adaptation)</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Social egg freezing allows women to preserve fertility for future family planning.
    </p>
  </div>
  <!-- Intro -->
  <div class="section">
    <p>
      This is done to preserve the fertility of unmarried women. Egg freezing involves freezing eggs (unfertilized eggs) collected from the ovaries, and then thawing them when a woman wishes to become pregnant. The fertilized eggs are then fertilized with sperm and returned to the uterus, allowing for the hope of pregnancy.

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>The frozen storage period is one year from the date of freezing. If you wish to extend the storage period, you will need to go through the renewal procedure every year, and a storage extension fee will be charged.</li>
                <li>At our hospital, we believe that cooperation with obstetric hospitals is essential because obstetric complications are more likely to occur when women are older at the time of birth. For this reason, we ask that you consider discarding your eggs around the age of 50, and that you cannot thaw or reuse them or extend the storage period beyond that age.</li>
                <li>In principle, our hospital cannot transfer frozen eggs. However, for those who are eligible for Tokyo Metropolitan Government subsidies, according to Tokyo Metropolitan Government policy, we can transfer frozen eggs to any certified facility within Tokyo. For those who are not eligible for Tokyo Metropolitan Government subsidies, we cannot transfer frozen eggs. We also cannot transfer frozen eggs overseas.</li>
